# Podcast Server (Work-in-progress)

**Note: This utility is still work-in-progress and should not be used in production environments.**

A simple macOS utility to generate podcast-compliant XML from a folder of audio files. Useful for testing podcast recordings with Overcast without uploading local podcasts to CMS services.
